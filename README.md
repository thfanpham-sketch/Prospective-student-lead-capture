Prospective Student Lead Capture – Business Analysis Objectives
Purpose: Demonstrate the future-state process and requirements for capturing prospective student leads.

Case Study
Prospective students browse course pages on the University’s website and want to express interest in studying. The Marketing team needs this information to include students in lead nurture campaigns (e.g., Open Day).

Problem Statement:

No online lead capture form exists; Marketing only learns about prospects at events (reactive process).
Marketing cannot proactively nurture leads before events.
Contact information collection is inconsistent, making campaign inclusion difficult.

Business Requirements
Goal: Implement an online Lead Capture form to allow future students to provide their contact information.
Objectives:

Capture key contact information (name, email, course interest).
Capture opt-in status for marketing communications.
Record this information in the University’s CRM (Salesforce).
